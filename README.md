# Collatz-conjecture-In-JAVA
Its the  Collatz conjecture in JAVA !

This is a program which asks the user to enter a positive integer and displays the sequence
of numbers obtained by the following process until it reaches 1:
 if the number is even then divide it by 2,
 if the number is odd then multiply it by 3 and add 1,
You now start again with the new number you have obtained.


It is not known whether, given any starting integer, the sequence always reaches 1.
This is known as the Collatz conjecture. It is amazing that a problem that is so easy
to state and understand is also extremely difficult to solv
